# Jonathan Sick's dotfiles

These dotfiles are shamelessly based on [Dan-FM's][] and [oh-my-zsh][].
This isn't a fork of those since I wanted to patiently sort through each file, select what I want, and carry-over design choices from my previous generation of dotfies.

## Architecture

My hope with these dotfiles is to maintain a generic cross-platform dotfile in the `master` branch, while maintaining branches specifically for Mac OS X, ubuntu, etc..
If anything, this will be a great git-cherry picking exercise!
